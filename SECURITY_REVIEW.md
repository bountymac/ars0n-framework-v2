# Security Review

This document summarizes the findings of a security review of the application.

## Summary

The application is a web-based interface for running various security scanning tools. The application is well-written and follows best practices for preventing common vulnerabilities like command injection and SQL injection. However, the lack of a comprehensive authentication and authorization system is a critical vulnerability that needs to be addressed immediately.

## Findings and Recommendations

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

*   **Finding:** **CRITICAL** - The application has no authentication or authorization on most of its API endpoints. This is a critical vulnerability. Anyone with network access to the application can run scans, access scan results, and manage API keys.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a robust authentication and authorization system. This could be based on a username/password system with sessions, or an API key system where a valid API key is required for every request. All endpoints should be protected by default, and only public endpoints (if any) should be explicitly excluded from authentication. Role-based access control (RBAC) should also be considered to restrict access to certain functionality based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).

### 2. Command Injection

*   **Finding:** **SECURE** - The application is not vulnerable to command injection. The developers have consistently used `exec.Command` in a secure manner, passing user-supplied data as separate arguments rather than concatenating them into the command string.
*   **Recommendation:** Continue to follow this best practice for all new code that executes external commands.

### 3. SQL Injection

*   **Finding:** **SECURE** - The application is not vulnerable to SQL injection. The developers have consistently used parameterized queries with the `pgx` library, which is the correct way to prevent this type of vulnerability.
*   **Recommendation:** Continue to use parameterized queries for all database interactions.

### 4. File Upload Vulnerabilities

*   **Finding:** **LOW RISK** - The file upload functionality is reasonably secure, but could be improved.
    *   No file type validation is performed.
    *   File permissions on the upload directory are too permissive (`0755`).
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Implement file type validation to ensure that only expected file types (e.g., `.txt`) can be uploaded. This can be done by checking the file extension and/or the file's magic bytes.
    *   Use more restrictive file permissions for the upload directory, such as `0700`, to ensure that only the application user can access the uploaded files.

## Overall Assessment

The application is a powerful tool that can be used to perform security scans. The lack of authentication and authorization is a critical vulnerability that needs to be addressed immediately. If this application is exposed to the internet, it could be used by malicious actors to attack any target.

The developers have done a good job of preventing command injection and SQL injection vulnerabilities, which are common in this type of application.

The file upload functionality is reasonably secure, but could be hardened.

My highest priority recommendation is to implement a comprehensive authentication and authorization system.
